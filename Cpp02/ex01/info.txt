Hereâ€™s how you can implement Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class, adding the new functionality for handling integers and floating-point numbers.

Plan
Enhancements to the Fixed Class
Add the following constructors:

A constructor to accept an integer and convert it to a fixed-point value.
A constructor to accept a floating-point number and convert it to a fixed-point value.
Add the following member functions:

toFloat: Converts the stored fixed-point value to a floating-point number.
toInt: Converts the stored fixed-point value to an integer.
Overload the insertion (<<) operator to output the fixed-point value as a floating-point representation.

Update the main.cpp to test all new features.
