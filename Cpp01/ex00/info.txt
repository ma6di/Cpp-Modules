The explicit keyword in C++ is used to prevent unintended 
implicit conversions or type coercion when a constructor 
is called.

In the context of your example:

cpp
Copy code
explicit Zombie(std::string name);
This means that the Zombie constructor that takes a std::string as its parameter can only be called explicitly, not implicitly.

Why Use explicit?
Without the explicit keyword, a single-argument constructor can act as an implicit conversion operator. For example:

cpp
Copy code
class Zombie {
public:
    Zombie(std::string name) : name(name) {}

private:
    std::string name;
};

int main() {
    Zombie z = "Undead";  // Implicitly converts "Undead" (std::string) to a Zombie object
    return 0;
}
In this code:

The string "Undead" is automatically converted into a Zombie object because the constructor accepts a std::string.
This might lead to unintended bugs, especially if you don't want your class to support such implicit conversions.
With explicit
If you declare the constructor as explicit:

cpp
Copy code
class Zombie {
public:
    explicit Zombie(std::string name) : name(name) {}

private:
    std::string name;
};

int main() {
    Zombie z = "Undead";  // Compilation error: no implicit conversion allowed
    Zombie z2("Undead");  // Works fine: constructor called explicitly
    return 0;
}
Here:

Zombie z = "Undead"; will not compile because the explicit keyword prevents the compiler from using the constructor for implicit conversions.
Zombie z2("Undead"); will work because the constructor is called explicitly.
When to Use explicit
You should use explicit:

For Single-Argument Constructors: To avoid accidental implicit conversions.
For Conversion Constructors: When a constructor can be used to convert one type into another, but you want to ensure it's only done explicitly.
Benefits of explicit
Prevents unintended or confusing code by avoiding implicit conversions.
Improves code clarity and robustness.
Helps enforce better programming practices by making conversions intentional and explicit.
In your example, marking the Zombie constructor as explicit ensures that only code like Zombie z("Undead"); or Zombie z = Zombie("Undead"); is valid, which makes the behavior of your program clearer and safer.
