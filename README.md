 C++ Modules
 
 🚀 Overview

The C++ Modules project is a comprehensive introduction to modern C++ features and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. 
Each module focuses on a specific concept, starting from basic class syntax and memory management, and moving toward inheritance, 
polymorphism, abstract classes, and exception handling.

 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

    ✨ Encapsulation
   Each class exposes only necessary functionality while keeping data hidden and protected.
   
    🔁 Inheritance
   Derived classes inherit from base classes to promote code reuse.
   
    🧬 Polymorphism
   Use of virtual functions allows dynamic behavior, especially via base-class pointers.
   
    📐 Abstraction
   Abstract base classes are used in modules like 04 and 05 to define interfaces.
