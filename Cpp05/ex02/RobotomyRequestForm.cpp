/*This function returns a pseudo-random integer between 0 and RAND_MAX (which is usually a big number like 32767).
% 2 gives the remainder when divided by 2, which will be either:
0 â†’ even
1 â†’ odd
So:
rand() % 2
Will randomly return 0 or 1 â€” with roughly 50% chance each.*/
	/* Random number
A truly random number comes from some unpredictable physical process (like radioactive decay or cosmic rays). Computers donâ€™t naturally do that.

ðŸŒ€ Pseudo-random number
This is what rand() gives you. It's:
Generated by a mathematical formula.
Looks random, but actually follows a predictable pattern.
If you use the same "starting point" (called a seed, like srand(42)), youâ€™ll get the same sequence every time.
Thatâ€™s why it's called pseudo (fake) random â€” it just appears random, but isnâ€™t truly unpredictable.
In C++98, rand() is your tool for this. In modern C++, you'd use <random> for better randomness â€” but not needed here.*/
